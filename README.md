### Stors 

*NO LONGER MAINTAINED*

A simple app to plan your day while giving time to each task. Don't take up too much on your plate and know when you are gonna be free. 

No lists, mobile app, assign, tags - it's not meant to replace your product management tool or massive todo lists. It's only meant for you to *peace out* and plan the day while knowing how much time it would take to get the work done you put on the plate.
